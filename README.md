Gain intuitive visual understanding of how atoms behave in liquids, solids and gases. With Atomify, your phone/tablet is transformed into a physics simulator allowing you to study realistic 3-dimensional interactions between argon atoms. Watch how crystals form, melt and transform into a gas.

In Atomify you are in charge of the universe. You are God. You can control the temperature and size of your system to see how this affects the behavior of the atoms. 

Six different systems are available for study: crystal, diffusion, chamber, fracture, wall crash and bullets. 


The simulation is performed with a high performance molecular dynamics model with the Lennard-Jones potential using standard parameters for argon.
